WIP.

STATUS: Dockerfiles and docker compose working for DEV machine.
Todo: - Now need to make sure correct ENV values are set, make sure API uses the ENV values instead of JSON, run migrates on API and AUTH, and run basic seed or write instruction for first site

A collection of subrepo's of the main servers of the Openstad application.

When the work is finished will allow with docker to run all servers with one command.

Currently dockerfiles or not in the master branches of the included repo's so will not work out of the box.
